# What is NSGAII?

---

> Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II

---

##  Three Main Features

- Non-dominated Sorting
- Elitism
- Crowding Distance

# Non-dominated sorting

---

A <span style="color:blue">non-dominated sorting</span> where all the
individual are sorted according to the level of non-domination.

# Elitism

---

An <span style="color:green">elitism</span> which stores all non-dominated
solutions, that enhancing fast convergence properties.

# Crowding distance

---

A <span style="color:yellow">crowding distance</span> that emphasize on less
crowded solutions to maintain the diversity and spread of the solutions.
